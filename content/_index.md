## Hi there, Panji is here.

A devoted father to my son and three furry feline companions. But in between the responsibilities of parenthood and cat wrangling, I'm also an enthusiastic but somewhat eccentric wordsmith. 

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I delight in weaving tales of the unnecessary, the whimsical, and the downright peculiar.

Feel free to explore my digital playground by clicking on the "Blog". You never know what you might stumble upon â€“ from heartwarming stories about fatherhood to whimsical adventures with my feline companions, there's something here for everyone. Just kidding...
